# Team Chess Agreement Plan

## Communication plan

### How will your group communicate with each other?

Slack

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to?

Team lead is going to make sure to check-in with every person, and everyone will have a chance to speak for team meetings. If anyone has a disagreement they must have a solution in mind, and be respectful to each other.

### Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety?

This group is a safe space, we are kind and will put the group first over personal gain. If things start to get out of hand then the team lead will take care of it.

## Conflict plan

### What will your group do when it encounters conflict?

Talk to the team lead, if you feel comfortable and they will consider best option to solve problems. Or bring it up in the group with a solution in mind that takes into consideration the rest of the team and how it impacts them. We will all decide together what to do.

### What will your process be to resolve it?

Take a break, catch your breath. That way when you come back, you are thinking straight and not acting out. Also if things get too crazy, then take a break.

## Work plan

### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

As a team we will identify tasks, and the team will vouch for they want to work on and why, from there the team lead will decide.

### In particular, make sure you know how you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the application, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems.

Github has stats and the team lead will check it out to make sure we all have meaningful contributions. Will also take into consideration putting together the presentation.

## Git process

### What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs?

Two mandatory branches, dev branch and pre-production. To make to a commit to dev, you must check out your individual branch, then pull from dev, write code, run all the tests, then and only then can you pull a request to dev.

### Any thing else you feel is important: expectations around work times, standup times, taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.

We will try to get into a groove first, and then meet MVP.

### Tasks

Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team. During that meeting the group should review the Team Agreement guidelines and decide on a course of action for items such as communication and conflict resolution. Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn't be a problem. It's important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.
